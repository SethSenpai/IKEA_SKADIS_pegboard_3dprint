# SKÅDIS pegboard 3d printable peg

This repo has the Fusion 360 archive file for a 3d printable [SKÅDIS pegboard](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skadis-pegboard-white-10321618/) peg.
The length of the peg is adjustable by editing the dimension in the sketch.

Included is a .3mf file with the inner length dimension set to 40mm. this means the total length from board to end is about 60 mm. 

**Test part settings**
* 0.2mm layer height
* 100% infill
* PLA
* No supports
* Build plate adhesion: Skirt 

The part is tested at both 30% gyroidal infill and 100% infill. Depending on your usecase 100% infill might be a necessity due to the reasonable flexibility of PLA. 30% infill will be able to hold up a bunch of reasonbly light things. Of course the shorter you make the length of the peg the more weight it can bare before flexing.
